                            <p>THE WEB. GRANDMOTHERS USING EBAY, five-year-olds accessing barney. com, and just about everyone in between are now using the Web. It has become as much a part of our lifestyle as Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and cell phones. (Does anyone even remember what life was like before ATMs and cell phones?) Now most companies include Web pages as part of their marketing materials, cities present their services on Web pages, and people display their photos on personal Web pages. You can find everything from movie listings to local weather to information for your child's history report on the Web.<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-0852-5_1">(Kurata, 2002)</a> <br>

                            <p>The World Wide Web (W3) was developed at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, by Tim Berners-Lee and his team. It was created to facilitate collaboration among scientists and engineers working on high-energy physics research. The idea for the web was inspired by a small personal hypertext system used for tracking information on distributed projects. The web was designed to allow independent projects to share information seamlessly without requiring centralized changes, enabling the smooth integration of new knowledge.
                            Key technologies like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) were developed to enable communication between clients (browsers) and servers. The client-server architecture of the web allows users to navigate through hypertext links to access information stored on servers worldwide. This scalability and simplicity have allowed the web to grow rapidly, becoming a global platform for sharing knowledge across national and disciplinary boundaries.<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/179606.179671">(Berners-Lee, Cailliau, et al., 1994)</a>

                    <h2>How a Web Page is Delivered</h2>
                    <p>Imagine back in 1993, when the World-Wide Web, the WWW, or the Web as we have generally come to call it, had just arrived. Especially in academia, where people had been using the Internet since the late 1970s and early 1980s in various ways and for various purposes including file transfer and email, it quickly became known that there was a new service around on the Internet. Using this new service, one could request a file written in a language called HTML, and if one had a program called a “browser” installed on his or her local machine, that program was able to display or “render” the HTML file when it arrived.<a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/58411/1/717284069.pdf">(Vossen & Hagemann, n.d.)</a></p>
                    
                    <p>The delivery of a web page is based on the client-server model, In the computing world today, client-server system has become so popular because it is being used virtually every day for different applications. Some of the standardized protocols that clients and servers use to communicate with themselves include: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Thus, Client-server system can be define as a software architecture made up of both the client and server, whereby the clients always send requests while the server responds to the requests sent. Client-server provides inter-process communication because it involves the exchange of data from both the client and server whereby each of them performs different functions.<a href="https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jce/papers/Vol16-issue1/Version-9/J016195771.pdf">(School of Computing Universiti Utara Malaysia Kedah, Malaysia & Oluwatosin, 2014)</a>. <br> The process involves the following steps:</p>

                    <div class="contentLeft">
                        <div class="textLeft">
                            <ol>
                                <li>User Enters a URL:</li>
                                <p>
                                    The user types a URL (Universal/Uniform Resource Locator) (e.g., www.example.com) into the browser, initiating a request for a web page.
                                    URLs are used to `locate' resources, by providing an abstract identification of the resource location.  Having located a resource, a system may perform a variety of operations on the resource, as might be characterized by such words as `access', `update', `replace', `find' attributes. In general, only the `access' method needs to be specified for any URL scheme.<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1738/">(Berners-Lee, Masinter, et al., 1994)</a> <br>
                                    Most URLs follow a standardized format of three main parts:
                                    •	The first part of the URL is called the scheme, and it describes the protocol used to access the resource. This is usually the HTTP protocol (http://).
                                    •	The second part gives the server Internet address (e.g., www.joes-hardware.com).
                                    •	The rest names a resource on the web server (e.g., /specials/saw-blade.gif).

                                <p>
                                    The browser uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the domain name into an IP address, which identifies the server hosting the website.
                                    The Domain Name System (DNS) provides name service for the DARPA Internet. It is one of the largest name services in operation today, serves a highly diverse community of hosts, users, and networks, and uses a unique combination of hierarchies, caching, and datagram access.<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/52324.52338">(Mockapetris & Dunlap, 1988)</a>

                                <p>
                                    The browser sends an HTTP or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server. Clients use HTTP to transact with web servers and their resources. An HTTP transaction consists of a request command (sent from the client to the server) and a response result (sent from the server back to the client). This communication happens with formatted blocks of data called HTTP messages.
                                    HTTP use TCP port 80 while HTTPS use port 443 which is more secure.<a href="https://books.google.ie/books?id=3EybAgAAQBAJ">(Gourley & Totty, 2002)</a>

                                    The server processes the request and sends back a response, which typically includes the web page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.<a href="https://books.google.ie/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fNQBEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT3&dq=understanding+dom&ots=tJCv0MzzXk&sig=B844_fvH5z_8iwoJj1lHmpVWOAE&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=understanding%20dom&f=false">(Rascia, n.d.)</a>

                                    The browser receives the response and renders the web page by interpreting the HTML (structure), applying CSS (styling), and executing JavaScript (interactivity). <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fNQBEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT3&dq=understanding+dom&ots=tJCv0MzzXk&sig=B844_fvH5z_8iwoJj1lHmpVWOAE&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=understanding%20dom&f=false">(Rascia, n.d.)</a>

                            <p>At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. The browser that you use to view the website is a program that interprets HTML and CSS and renders the style, content, and structure into the page that you see. In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model. This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects. JavaScript is an interactive language.</p>
                            <p>The Document Object Model, usually referred to as the DOM, is an essential part of making websites interactive. It is an interface that allows a programming language to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a website. JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser. Almost any time a website performs an action, such as rotating between a slideshow of images, displaying an error when a user attempts to submit an incomplete form, or toggling a navigation menu, it is the result of JavaScript accessing and manipulating the DOM <a href="https://books.google.ie/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fNQBEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT3&dq=understanding+dom&ots=tJCv0MzzXk&sig=B844_fvH5z_8iwoJj1lHmpVWOAE&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=understanding%20dom&f=false">(Rascia, n.d.)</a></p>

                    <p>In this report, we explored the history of the web, how web pages are delivered, and how they work. The web has come a long way since its inception, evolving from a simple tool for sharing documents to a global platform for communication, commerce, and entertainment. Understanding the client-server model, the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the importance of the DOM is essential for appreciating how the web works and how it continues to shape our world.</p>
